## Uber for Tickets

A Web app where you can offer tickets for events.

Clone this repo, and in both folders (client + server) `yarn install` followed by `yarn start`
* Make sure to have Docker running a Postgres database on port 5432 before starting the server

For Admin role, change via Postgres DB client like Postico the isAdmin boolean in the users table to true for the created user that you wish to be administrator. Login as that user after that.

## Deployed version:
A deployed version of the app can be found at: `https://pvd-tickets-client.herokuapp.com` 
* if you wish to try out administrator posibilities, please email or Slack PM me the user-email that you want to be admin.
